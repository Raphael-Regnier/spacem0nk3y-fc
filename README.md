# JAMStack web project - starter files

These are the starting files used by [RaphaÃ«l Regnier](https://raphaelregnier.design) to create web projects. They are based on the blog project by [Kevin Powell](https://kevinpowell.co) featured in the tutorial link bellow.

The `src` folder contains files so that you can get your project up and running without worrying about content for posts/articles. That folder contains:

- HTML files to use as a base for the different page layouts. These can be turned into the templates that will be used.
- CSS file for styling the pages
- 5 blog articles in the `blog` folder
- images and a logo in the `assets` folder

The articles are written in Markdown, and include Front Matter.


## Tutorial

You can [watch this video](https://youtu.be/4wD00RT6d-g) to see how Kevin Powel uses Eleventy, Netlify, and Netlify CMS to create a full-featured blog site built entirely with static files.
